# HexVolumeRenderer

A program for rendering hexahedral meshes in the form of transparent volumes.

This repository was created for the paper

Interactive Focus+Context Rendering for Hexahedral Mesh Inspection. \
Christoph Neuhauser, Junpeng Wang, RÃ¼diger Westermann. \
to appear in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 2021 (TVCG 2021). \
DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2021.3074607

The rendering mode discussed in the paper can be used when selecting the renderer "ClearView (Unified)" in the program.
The LOD structure discussed can be viewed with the renderer "LOD Lines (Preview, Sheets)".


## Building and running the programm

Currently, there are three main ways to compile the program:
- Linux: Using the system package manager to install all dependencies (tested: apt on Ubuntu, pacman on Arch Linux).
- Linux & Windows: Installing all dependencies using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
- Windows: Using MSYS2 to install all dependencies.

A build script `build.sh` is available in the project root directory that builds the application using the system
package manager on Linux and MSYS2 on Windows. Please download and install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ if you wish
to use this build script and run the script from an MSYS2 shell.
Alternatively, we recommend to use vcpkg if the users wants to compile the application with Microsoft Visual Studio.
A build script using MSVC and vcpkg, `build-msvc.bat`, is available in the project root directory.
Guides for manual compilation for the different build types can be found in the directory `docs/compilation`.


## How to add new data sets

This program optionally supports downloading data sets from HexaLab. The user is responsible himself or herself that he or she has the rights to do this. For more details on HexaLab see:

Furthermore, the user can edit the index.json file in the directory Data/Meshes/ to add meshes manually.
Please note that the file is overwritten when using the downloading functionality.
