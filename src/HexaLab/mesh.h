// How to save a lot of mem
// Darts are quite verbous, you need 48 of them for a hexa, and in most of 'reasonable' subdivisions they are uselessy repetitive
// Nice trick is to compact them (e.g. moving to halfedge like structures) 
// This can be done implicitly
// consider that for example the four darts inside a wedge: they share the same cell and edge and refers two vertices and two faces; 
// You always will have this 4plets of darts, so if you keep them distributed in fixed way in a vector you can avoid to explicitly store them. 
// In this way you store a vector of N/4 FatDarts that can be used to represent a vector of N darts and simply use the 2 LSB to disambiguate a FatDart into the right dart.
