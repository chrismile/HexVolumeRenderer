## Supported Operating Systems

The build process was tested on...
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Windows 10 using MSYS2

## Build Process on Ubuntu 20.04

Please execute the script `setup.sh` on the command line.
It will compile and install all requirements, download the data sets, build the program and execute the program
reproducing Figure 19 (right) from the paper. Please note that super user rights need to be given to parts of the
